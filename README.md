<h2/>Privacy Policy<h2/>
Before using Vivre, you agree by the privacy policy displayed here. Please read through it carefully.
What data we store and how we use it
All this data stored is necessary as the listed commands can not function without them.
Guild IDs - For warn commands.
User IDs - For warn commands.
Who can access the data?
Only owner of vivre can access this data. Data does not get shared with third parties.
Can you delete my data?
It is possible to get your data deleted, or you can just delete it by yourself with $clearwarn command.
Note that this only deletes data for the guild you are in, data about your warns in other guilds does not get deleted, and the process should be repeated in the other guilds for that as well.

Besides that, it's also possible to contact us so we can delete all your data in the database. To do this, simply send us an email at vivrebot@gmail.com, or join our support server with your user ID and/or guild ID and we will delete the data. This can however take several days, so we ask you to be patient.
